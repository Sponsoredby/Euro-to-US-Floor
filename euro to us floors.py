#This converts european lift numbers to US numbers, I didnt even know this was a thing
inp = input ("European Floor? ") #this asks the user to enter a floor number
usf = int (inp) +1 # this converts the string for European Floor to an integer so we can add 1 to it 
print ("US floor", usf) # displays the result
# in the future come back and learn data validation
